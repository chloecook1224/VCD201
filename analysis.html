                <h2>Design Intent & Goals</h2>
                <p>
                    My goal for this project was to create a cyberpunk-inspired interface that reflects the futuristic and neon lights tone of the genre. I aimed to balance aesthetic flair with usability by using a bold color palette, glowing text, and large typography.

                <h2>Challenges & Problem-Solving</h2>
                <p>
                    One of the major challenges was ensuring the navigation system stayed anchored to the main logo (VCD201) regardless of scroll or screen size. This was resolved through JavaScript recalculating positions dynamically during scroll and resize events.

            <div class="analysis-section">
                <h2>Visual Strategy</h2>
                <p>
                    The visual language is built around neon glow, dark backgrounds, and a street-style font. These elements work together to establish an immersive, high-tech aesthetic that supports the overall mood of the site.

                <p>
                    This project helped solidify my understanding of responsive design, user interaction, and aesthetic cohesion. I’ve also improved my ability to work with AI and code along with it, having it make a basis for me and fixing its mistakes made coding fast and easy for me.
