                <p>By Elvis Canziba</p>
                <p>This book is a practical guide that helps developers understand and apply UX (User Experience) principles to build better, more user-friendly digital products. It bridges the gap between design and development, showing how even developers without formal design training can Understand core UX principles like usability, accessibility, and user-centered design. It also explains how to apply UX thinking throughout the development process, use tools like wireframes, mockups, and user personas, and test and validate designs through prototyping and user feedback.</p>
                    <p> 
                    <li>Creating intuitive interfaces – ensuring the navigation links appear clearly and consistently.</li>
                    <li>User-centered design – designing with the user in mind.</li>
                    <li>Visual hierarchy and feedback – using animation, glow effects, and positioning to guide users.</li>

                <p><b>How to improve your UI/UX design skills as a Developer</b></p>
                <p>By Stephen McLean</p>
                <p>This article (or resource) typically offers practical tips for developers who want to strengthen their design mindset and build more user-friendly interfaces. It usually includes ideas like Studying design patterns used in popular apps and websites, learning the basics of visual hierarchy, spacing, typography, and color theory, practicing by redesigning existing apps or doing small UI challenges, getting feedback from designers and collaborating cross-discipline, and understanding the importance of empathy in user experience design.</p>
                <p>
                    <li>Thinking like a designer—not just coding a menu but making it feel dynamic, intentional, and tied visually to the title.</li>
                    <li>Learning how positioning, animation, and responsiveness impact the user's experience.</li>
                    <li>Layout decisions are made based on how users interact with the page, which is core to UX.</li>
                    <li>Iterating and debugging is a real-world design/dev process.</li>

                <p><b>Unleash the Power of JavaScript: Build Interactive Websites</b></p>
                <p>By AIContentfy team</p>
                <p>This article emphasizes JavaScript's transformative role in creating dynamic, engaging websites. It covers how JavaScript:
                    <li>Turns static pages into interactive experiences through DOM manipulation and events.</li>
                    <li>Powers features like menus, sliders, modals, animations, and dynamic content updates.</li>
                    <li>Enables responsive behavior based on user actions (like clicks, scrolls, hover effects).</li>
                    <li>Enhances user engagement by making interfaces more intuitive and lively</li>
                </p>
                <p>Since I already have a lot of experience in CSS and HTML and less with JS, as I only used it for simple animations, I really wanted to explore what I could do with it with AI's help.</p>

                <p>By Hanna Moroz </p>
                <p>This article explores how JavaScript empowers developers to build websites that go beyond static design by:
                    <li>Creating dynamic interfaces that respond to user actions.</li>
                    <li>Enabling real-time interactivity, like toggling menus, loading content without refreshing, and reacting to scrolls or clicks.</li>
                    <li>Powering animations, visual effects, and transitions that enhance user engagement.</li>
                    <li>Allowing developers to manipulate the DOM, making it possible to move, update, or style elements directly through code.</li>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <li>Using JavaScript to toggle navigation visibility, making my title interactive.</li>
                    <li>Applying DOM manipulation to position nav links dynamically around the central title.</li>
                    <li>Design choices include glowing animations and event-driven responses (like hover effects), which mirror the article's focus on engagement.
                        Making my site responsive and screen-aware speaks to the core theme of building smarter, adaptable interfaces.</li>
